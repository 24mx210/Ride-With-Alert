RideWithAlert – Smart Emergency Alert & Vehicle Monitoring System

(Full-Stack MERN Project – Laptop Simulation Version)

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW (READ CAREFULLY)

Build a production-grade, full-stack web application called RideWithAlert.

The system simulates vehicle-mounted worker dashboards and a manager control dashboard, all running on laptop browsers.

The goal is to provide a real-time emergency alert system where:

Drivers can instantly raise emergencies

Managers receive alarms, live location, and video evidence

Nearby police and hospital control rooms receive alerts (simulated via API/logs)

Acknowledgement stops alarms on both sides

All emergency data is permanently stored

This project must be fully functional, real-time, cleanly structured, and professionally coded.

2. USERS & ROLES
2.1 Manager

Logs in via Manager Dashboard (Laptop)

Registers vehicles

Registers drivers

Assigns drivers to vehicles

Receives emergency alerts

Views emergency video, map, and details

Stops alarm & sends acknowledgement

2.2 Driver (Worker)

Logs in via Vehicle Dashboard (Laptop)

Sees assigned vehicle details

Tracks live location

Can access camera

Triggers emergency alert

Receives acknowledgement

2.3 Police & Hospital Control Room (Simulated)

Receives emergency alerts via backend notification logs / mock API calls

3. SYSTEM ASSUMPTIONS (IMPORTANT)

All dashboards run on laptop browsers

Each vehicle dashboard is simulated

Laptop camera is used for emergency video

Laptop geolocation API is used for live location

Police & hospital alerts are simulated, not real integrations

4. COMPLETE FUNCTIONAL FLOW (STRICT)
4.1 Manager Flow

Manager logs into Manager Dashboard

Registers vehicles (vehicle number, type, fuel capacity)

Registers drivers (name, phone, license, driver ID)

Assigns a driver to a vehicle

Waits for emergency alerts

Receives alarm sound on emergency

Views:

Driver details

Vehicle details

Live location on map

Emergency video

Clicks Acknowledge / Stop Alarm

Alarm stops on both dashboards

Acknowledgement message sent to driver

Emergency stored permanently in DB

4.2 Driver (Vehicle Dashboard) Flow

Driver logs in

Sees assigned vehicle & manager details

Dashboard shows:

Live map

Fuel range (mock data)

Camera preview

Emergency button

Location updates continuously

On emergency:

Driver clicks Emergency Button

Alarm plays immediately

System auto-records 30–60 sec video

Captures:

Driver details

Vehicle details

Timestamp

Location

Emergency sent in real-time

Driver sees Acknowledged status after manager action

5. REAL-TIME REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

Use Socket.IO

Real-time alarm triggering

Real-time location updates

Real-time acknowledgement updates

No page refresh allowed for alerts

6. TECHNOLOGY STACK (STRICT)
Backend

Node.js

Express.js

MongoDB + Mongoose

Socket.IO

Multer (video upload)

JWT Authentication

dotenv

Frontend

React.js (Vite or CRA)

Axios

Socket.IO Client

HTML5 Geolocation API

HTML5 MediaDevices API

Leaflet or Google Maps (free tier)

7. DATABASE SCHEMA (MANDATORY)
Driver
{
  driverId: String,
  name: String,
  phone: String,
  licenseNumber: String,
  assignedVehicle: ObjectId,
  createdAt: Date
}

Vehicle
{
  vehicleNumber: String,
  type: String,
  fuelCapacity: Number,
  assignedDriver: ObjectId,
  createdAt: Date
}

Emergency
{
  driverId: ObjectId,
  vehicleId: ObjectId,
  location: {
    latitude: Number,
    longitude: Number
  },
  videoUrl: String,
  status: "ACTIVE" | "ACKNOWLEDGED",
  timestamp: Date
}

8. API REQUIREMENTS (MUST IMPLEMENT ALL)
